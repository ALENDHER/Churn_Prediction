## Project Overview

**Customer Churn Prediction** is a machine learning project aimed at identifying customers who are likely to leave a business or subscription-based service. This project leverages advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict churn and help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

### Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides visual insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models:**  Implements algorithm like Decision Tree for churn prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlights the most significant factors influencing customer churn.

## Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization during EDA.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For developing and presenting the project.

### How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreevardhanp99/Churn_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Churn_Prediction  

   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook  
    ```
5. Open main.ipynb to explore the churn preditction project and execute the code.

### Project Workflow
- **Data Collection:** Import the dataset into the project.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize churn patterns and feature relationships.
- **Model Training:** Train and compare machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the best model.
- **Deployment:** Prepare the model for real-world use (optional).
